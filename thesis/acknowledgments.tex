\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

To begin, I would like to acknowledge that the analysis described in this thesis was a large effort carried out by many others at CERN beyond just myself. My primary focus during the analysis was in developing the muon fake rate, helping build the multivariate analysis tools, and analyzing backgrounds. I'd like to specifically thank Dima Kovalskyi, Christoph Paus, Zhangqier Wang, Kai-Feng Chen, Wei-Hsiang Huang, and Priyanka Sadangi for their contributions to the rest of the analysis, I hope this thesis properly represents the results of all your hard work.

Friends in the lab: Luca, Pietro, Ludo, Marti, Kyungseop, and Chad

The old groups I've been a part of: MIT (Dylan Rankin and Phillip Harris) and ETP (Markus Klute, Minseok, Jan, Joost, Neils, etc.)

Daniel Harlow??

Lastly, my love for physics has come from a love of learning from and hanging out with the people I have met along the way, many of whom I have most certainly missed.
